            <p><img src="images/WhatIsAFixer.jpg" /><a href="index#how-work"> Fixers are highly-skilled SAP experts</a> who specialize in one or more SAP modules and who provide quick and effective solutions to Members' requests.  Examples of Fixers are as follows:</p>
            
            <ul class="custm_ul">
				<li>SAP Consultants and Freelancers</li>
				<li>Full-time Employees that are up for some extra work (and cash)</li>
				<li>Seasoned SAP veterans that still want to utilize their skills</li>
			</ul>
            <div class="clearfix"></div><br>
            <p><strong>Here’s how the Fixer process works!</strong></p>
			<ol type="1" class="custm_li">
				<li> Fixers should sign up the ERPfixer’s website and choose the <a href="${pageContext.request.contextPath}/sapModules">SAP modules</a> that they specialize in.</li>
				<li> When a request is posted by a Member, an email is sent to all the Fixers (unless the Member chooses a specific Fixer) based on the matching of the request category with the Fixer’s specialist area.</li>
				<li> By clicking on the link in the email, the Fixer needs to log-in to the ERPfixers website and then they will be able to claim the request.</li>
				<li> All Fixers that receive the email can view the request. However, once a Fixer claim the request, no other Fixer can accept it.</li>
				<li> Fixers should respond to Members’ requests within 24 hours.</li>
				<li> Fixer communicates with the Member using the ERPfixers chat functionality, to resolve the issue.</li>
				<li> The Fixer and Member can also use the screensharing tools provided in the chat area, so that they can share a screen. </li>
				<li> Once the request is completed and resolved, the Member can click on the “Fixed” button and the Fixer will be notified</li>
				<li> Every request that is posted is equal to one credit ($40 value). However, if Fixer feels that a request will take longer than (approximately) 30 - 45 minutes to solve they can ask the Member to split the request into multiple credits</li>
				<li>All requests resolved by Fixers will be tallied up and used to pay Fixer through PayPal* at the end of the month.
</li>
