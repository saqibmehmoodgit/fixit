            <p><img src="images/WhatIsAMember.jpg" /> <a href="index#how-work">Members are our valued customers</a> who seek quality support and assistance for their SAP issues and requests.</p>
            
            <p>Examples of members are as follows:</p>
            
            <ul class="custm_ul">
                <li>SAP Customers looking for quality access to SAP expertise</li>
                <li>SAP End Users</li>
                <li> SAP Consultants needing an extra set of hands</li>
            </ul>
             <div class="clearfix"></div><br>
            <p><strong>Here’s how the Member process works!</strong></p>
            <ol type="1" class="custm_li">
                <li> Once a Member has signed up, they can buy credits in packages of 5, 10 or 20 credits</li>
                <li> Each credit can be used to post one request, which is the equivalent of about 45 minutes of a Fixer’s time</li>
                <li> A Member can post a request in the specific <a href="${pageContext.request.contextPath}/sapModules">SAP module</a> that their issue relates to.</li>
                <li> The Member can choose a specific Fixer (after viewing the Fixer’s profile), or leave the request open to the first Fixer in that specialist area that claims the request</li>
                <li> A Fixer will respond to the request within 24 hours</li>
                <li> Member communicates with the Fixer using the ERPfixers chat functionality in order to resolve the request</li>
                <li> The Member and Fixer can also use the screensharing tools provided in the chat area, so that they can share a screen. </li>
                <li> If a request is likely to take much longer than 45 minutes to work on, the Fixer may request that the Member creates multiple requests for the issue</li>
                <li> If the Member is not satisfied with the Fixer that has claimed the request, they can open up the request again to other Fixers or reassign it to another Fixer</li>
                <li> Once the request is completed and resolved, the Member can click on the “Fixed” button and rate the Fixer
                </li>
            </ol>
