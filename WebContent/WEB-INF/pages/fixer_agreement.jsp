          <li><p> Except as prohibited by law, if there is liability found on our part, you agree that it will be limited to the amount paid to you as a Fixer for the calendar month preceding the date upon which you made us aware of your claim in writing, and under no circumstances will there be consequential, punitive, or any other kind of exemplary damages.

Applicable law may not allow the limitation or exclusion of liability or incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you. You may have other rights that vary from state to state.</p>
          <p>For Jurisdictions that do not allow us to limit our liability:</p>
          <p>Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement, if your jurisdiction has provisions specific to waiver or liability that conflict with the above then our liability is limited to the smallest extent possible by law.  Specifically, in jurisdictions where it is not legally permitted, we do not disclaim liability for: (a) death or personal injury caused by its negligence or that of any of its officers, employees or agents; or (b) fraudulent misrepresentation; or (c) any liability which it is not lawful to exclude either now or in the future.</p>
          <p>IF YOU ARE A RESIDENT OF A JURISDICTION THAT REQUIRES A SPECIFIC STATEMENT REGARDING RELEASE THEN THE FOLLOWING APPLIES.  FOR EXAMPLE, CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS MUST, AS A CONDITION OF THIS AGREEMENT, WAIVE THE APPLICABILITY OF CALIFORNIA CIVIL CODE SECTION 1542, WHICH STATES, "A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS OR HER FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE, WHICH IF KNOWN BY HIM OR HER MUST HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS OR HER SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR."  YOU HEREBY WAIVE THIS SECTION OF THE CALIFORNIA CIVIL CODE.  YOU HEREBY WAIVE ANY SIMILAR PROVISION IN LAW, REGULATION, OR CODE THAT HAS THE SAME INTENT OR EFFECT AS THE AFOREMENTIONED RELEASE.</p>
          </li>
         <li><p> You agree that we will not liable for any delay or failure in performance under this Agreement resulting directly or indirectly from acts of God, terrorism, or other causes beyond our reasonable control.</p></li>
         <li><p> Any notices or communications under this Agreement shall be by electronic mail or in any other written form and shall be deemed delivered upon receipt by the party to whom such communication is directed if sent to the applicable address shown in this paragraph. If to us (Provider), such notices shall be addressed to admin@ERPfixers.com. If to you (Fixer), such notices shall be addressed to the electronic or mailing address specified in your account information, or such other address as either party may give the other by notice as provided in this paragraph. It is the Fixer's responsibility to provide an accurate address and to ensure that we are notified of any changes to Fixer's address as specified in this paragraph.</p></li>
         <li><p>This Agreement and the relationship between Fixer and Provider are governed by the Laws of the State of Connecticut, U.S.A. without regard to that state's conflict of laws rules. Fixer and Provider hereby submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the Superior Court of the State of Connecticut, Fairfield County, for the resolution of disputes arising from or in connection with this Agreement. Failure to exercise or to enforce any right or provision of the Agreement will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of the Agreement is found by a Court of Competent Jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the Court should endeavor to give effect to the parties' intentions as reflected in the subject provision and in the Agreement, without statutory presumptions against the drafter, and they agree that all other provisions of the Agreement will remain in full force and effect, except to the extent that the parties' intentions as reflected in the subject provision and in the Agreement would not be carried out. The parties expressly agree that the United Nations Convention for the International Sale of Goods does not apply to this Agreement. Fixer agrees that regardless of any Statute or Law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to the Site or to the Agreement must be filed in a Superior Court of the State of Connecticut in Fairfield County within one (1) calendar year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred. </p></li>

         <li><p> If either party employs attorneys to enforce any rights arising out of or relating to this agreement, the losing party shall reimburse the prevailing party for its reasonable attorneys' fees, court fees, and any other expenses awarded by a court of competent jurisdiction.</p></li>

          
          <li> <p>This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to your activities as a Fixer and supersedes all previous oral and/or written proposals, representations, writings, and other communications between the parties with respect to such subject matter other than our Terms and Conditions and/or our Privacy Policy. Any amendments or other changes to this Agreement must be in writing and signed by the party to be bound, or its duly authorized representative.
